# Contributing to AskEngine

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AskEngine as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer



## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/askengine/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/askengine/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs(different lengths in different editors)
* Keep line length under 100 characters
* Run `pylint` for style enforcement
* Write tests for new code
* Document all functions and classes
